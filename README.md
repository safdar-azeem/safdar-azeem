<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Safdar Azeem</h1>

<p>Hi! I am a MERN | MEAN | VUE | REACT-NATIVE | SVELTE Developer. I have several years of experience in Development. Iâ€™ve been interested in programming since my childhood, because it gave me freedom to build something with which people can interact, and it didnâ€™t require a big investment. All I needed was a computer and programming courses. I'm a self-taught developer and love to help others figure out programming on their own as well, experience working on Agile methodologies for projects. Big attention to detail while keeping focus on the whole picture. I have strong abilities to supervise development process and thanks to great communication skills I am able to solve problems. I created some websites for my personal projects and I Build a lot of applications for very small companies and pretty huge ones I am familiar with a wide range of programming utilities and languages. </p>

- ðŸ“š I'm currently learning Blockchain Development,
